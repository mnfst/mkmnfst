mkmnfst (0.3)

  * Bugfix: the signature could sometimes be unterminated. After
    gpgme_data_read(3) returns 0 bytes, terminate the buffer string with \0.
  * Bugfix: catch missing private keys. If you pass a keyid and the keyid is
    not that of a secret key then it will not set the key. In this case it
    checks it against NULL. However, `key` must be NULL initially for this to
    work.
  * Support offline master keys. We previously searched for secret keys, which
    ignores secret subkeys. Instead we now search all keys in the keyring,
    skipping those that cannot sign (also those that are revoked, expired,
    disabled, or invalid). The result is that the user can specify the master
    keyid even if their master key is offline but they have a usable signing
    subkey.
